F.A.Q.
* Do you accept donations? 
Not for this app. Please place any donations in the Worldwide Work (Mt 24:14) donations box at your local Kingdom Hall.
* Can you add features?
If I have time and feel it's useful :)
* How do I add my language?
- Download the ePub file for your language from http://jw.org/ (English is already included, no need to import it). 
- Then use the import button in the app to import the ePub file. This process may take a while. 
- Click on Preferences and choose your language, then restart the app (close/open)
- You can also create a widget with your prefered language on the home screen. Clicking on the widget will load the main app in the same langauge
